capDL-tool
==========

This tool is intended to be used with capDL textual specifications. In
particular, it can parse input files into a variety of different output
formats, including Isabelle theory files and C source files that can be given
to the capDL initialiser.

For usage instructions run 'make' and then './parse-capDL'.

For details of the Capability Distribution Language, see the specification in
the 'doc/' directory. Run 'make' in that directory to generate 'capDL.pdf'.


Repository overview
-------------------

  * 'CapDL': Haskell source code of the tool
  * '*.cdl': Toy examples used as test files
  * '*.right': Canonical representations of the examples used in testing
  * 'doc': Latex source of the capDL Specification


Dependencies
-------------

[Cabal][1] should automatically retrieve all necessary Haskell dependencies to
build this tool, but if you need exact dependency information it is available
in [`capDL-tool.cabal`](capDL-tool.cabal).

You can install cabal package dependencies either in a sandbox in the build
directory or in the current user's home.

To install cabal dependencies in a sandbox run

    make sandbox

To install cabal dependencies in the user's home run

    make userdeps
